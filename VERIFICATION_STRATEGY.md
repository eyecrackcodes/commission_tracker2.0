## 🔄 Field Transformation Strategy

### Current → New Naming Convention

| Current | New | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Date Commission Paid | **Date Verified** | Agent verification action |
| Payment Period | **Payment Status** | Clear status indication |
| Commission Paid | **Verified** | Simplified status |

### Implementation Benefits

- ✅ **Verification-Focused**: Emphasizes agent responsibility
- ✅ **Retention Tool**: Early warning system for cancellations
- ✅ **Reconciliation Aid**: Cross-reference with DigitalBGA spreadsheets

## 💡 Enhanced Workflow Design

### 1. **Verification Process**
```
Policy Creation → Payment Period → Agent Verification → Date Verified Set
                                      ↓
                              Carrier Website Check
                                      ↓
                              DigitalBGA Spreadsheet Match
```

### 2. **Status Indicators**
- **🟡 Pending Verification**: Payment period arrived, needs verification
- **✅ Verified**: Agent confirmed commission received
- **🔴 Investigation Required**: Multiple periods without verification
- **⚠️ At Risk**: Pattern suggests possible cancellation

### 3. **Early Warning System**
Automatically flag policies for retention action:
- No verification 30+ days past payment date
- Multiple missed payment periods
- Carrier portal shows "lapsed" or "terminated"

## 🛡️ Client Retention Integration

### Retention Triggers
| Scenario | Action Required | Timeline |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| No verification 30+ days | Immediate client contact | Within 24 hours |
| 2nd missed payment | Retention call + offers | Within 48 hours |
| Carrier shows "lapsed" | Emergency intervention | Immediate |
| Pattern of late payments | Proactive support call | Weekly check-in |

### Retention Action Workflow
1. **Identify**: System flags at-risk policies
2. **Contact**: Agent calls client immediately
3. **Diagnose**: Understand cancellation reason
4. **Solve**: Offer payment plans, coverage adjustments
5. **Document**: Record actions in policy comments
6. **Follow-up**: Schedule regular check-ins

## 📊 Enhanced Analytics & Reporting

### New Metrics to Track
- **Verification Rate**: % of eligible policies verified within 7 days
- **Retention Success**: % of flagged policies saved through intervention
- **Pipeline Health**: Consistency of future expected commissions
- **Early Warning Accuracy**: % of flagged policies that were actually at risk

### Dashboard Enhancements
- **Verification Queue**: Policies requiring immediate verification
- **Retention Alerts**: Clients needing immediate contact
- **Performance Metrics**: Agent verification and retention rates
- **Reconciliation View**: Compare with DigitalBGA spreadsheet data
