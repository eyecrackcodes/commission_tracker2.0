### Why Verification Matters
The "Date Verified" field is your **most important tool** for:
- ✅ Confirming commissions actually paid
- ✅ Cross-referencing DigitalBGA payment spreadsheets
- ✅ Identifying potential policy cancellations
- ✅ Tracking payment timing patterns

### Verification Workflow Steps

#### 1. **Check Payment Periods**
- Pipeline shows expected payment dates
- DigitalBGA pays twice monthly (15th & 30th typically)
- Payments arrive 2-3 days after payment date

#### 2. **Verify on Carrier Website** 
When payment period arrives:
1. Log into carrier agent portal
2. Check commission statement/payment history
3. Confirm specific policy commissions paid
4. Note any missing or delayed payments

#### 3. **Update Date Verified**
- ✅ **If Paid**: Set "Date Verified" to payment date
- ❌ **If Not Paid**: Leave empty, investigate why
- 📝 **Add Comments**: Note any issues or delays

#### 4. **Cross-Reference Spreadsheet**
- Compare your verified dates with DigitalBGA's payment spreadsheet
- Report discrepancies to commission team
- Use for reconciliation and audit purposes

## 🔄 Commission Reconciliation System

### Automated Reconciliation Reminders
The system now provides **intelligent reconciliation reminders** to ensure you never miss commission verification deadlines:

#### **When Commission Sheets Are Released**
- **Timing**: 9 days before payment (e.g., July 30 for August 8 payment)
- **Animated Modal**: Money animations (💰💵🤑) with clear call-to-action
- **Floating Badge**: Persistent on-screen reminder until completed
- **Auto-Navigation**: Takes you directly to reconciliation workflow

#### **Smart Completion Tracking**

### Reconciliation Workflow (Pipeline Tab)
