# 🔔 Internal Notification System Documentation

## 📋 Overview

Automated notification system to help agents proactively manage client payment verifications and cancellation follow-ups, ensuring no potential client is lost due to missed follow-up opportunities.

## 🎯 Business Rules Implementation

### 1. **Payment Verification Notifications**

#### Trigger Conditions:
- **Status**: Policy status = "Pending"
- **Date Check**: First payment date ≤ Today
- **Frequency**: Once per day during business hours (8 AM - 6 PM)
- **Exclusions**: Weekends suppressed

#### Priority Levels:
| Days Overdue | Priority | Color | Icon |
|--------------|----------|-------|------|
| 0-2 days | Low | Blue | 💡 |
| 3-6 days | Medium | Yellow | ⏰ |
| 7+ days | High | Orange | ⚠️ |

#### Agent Actions:
- **Mark Active**: Updates policy status, removes from notifications
- **Mark Cancelled**: Triggers cancellation follow-up workflow
- **View Policy**: Quick access to policy details

### 2. **Cancellation Follow-Up Notifications**

#### Trigger Conditions:
- **Status**: Policy status = "Cancelled"
- **Timeline**: Days 1-3 after cancellation
- **Assignment**: Original agent (Days 1-3), Retention team (Day 4+)
- **Priority**: Urgent (Day 1), High (Days 2-3)

#### Follow-Up Workflow:
```
Day 1: 🚨 URGENT - Immediate client contact required
Day 2: 🔴 HIGH - Second retention attempt
Day 3: 🔴 HIGH - Final agent attempt
Day 4+: Retention team takes over (no agent notifications)
```

#### Agent Actions:
- **Called Client**: Log contact attempt
- **Reactivated**: Policy restored to Active status
- **View Policy**: Access client details for contact
